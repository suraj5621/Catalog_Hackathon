## Steps to Run the Code

1. Open your terminal.
   
2. Navigate to the directory where your solution.js file is located. Use the following command to move to the desired directory:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/directory
3. Ensure that the testcase.json file is located in the same directory as solution.js.
   
4. Run the solution.js file using Node.js with the following command:
    node Secret_code.js
5. The terminal will display the output, which includes the secrets (constant terms) for each test case.
